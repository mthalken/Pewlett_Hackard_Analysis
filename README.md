# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the age of employees based on retirement age to give managers a since of a timeline for new hires to fill the roles. We also did an analysis of individuals for a mentorship program with the same data. 

## Project Overview:
1. Create an ERD to help visualize the data. 
2. Organize, clean, and create tables for management to see the number of potential retirees.
3. Get a count of potential retirees for each department. 
4. Find the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program.
